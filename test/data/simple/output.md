## A level 2 title

__Insistently__ Bow ties are _cool_!

---

Separators should use three characters.

Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do! You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better?

### A level 3 title

```markdown
## Let's see how the parser handles markdown code

Haha tricky innit?
```

```
This code should still be in fences after formatting
```

This `part-here` should not be changed

```js
process.stderr.write('Wrong fences bro!');
```

## Another level 2 title

* Bullets must be '\*', thematic indentation requires 4 spaces!
  * It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'!
  * Did I mention we have comfy chairs?
* No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness.

1. Saving the world with meals on wheels.
   1. The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.…hey.…the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant.
2. I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in.
