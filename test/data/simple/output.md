## A level 2 title

__Insistently__ Bow ties are _cool_!

Separators should use three characters.

Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do! You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better?

```markdown
## Let's see how the parser handles markdown code

Haha tricky innit?

## Another level 2 title

* Bullets must be '\*', thematic indentation requires 4 spaces!
  * It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'!
  * Did I mention we have comfy chairs?
* No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness.

1. Saving the world with meals on wheels.

2. I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in.
